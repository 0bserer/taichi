Differentiable programming
==========================

Please check out `the DiffTaichi paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.00935.pdf>`_ and `video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1xvAZve9aE>`_ to learn more about Taichi differentiable programming.

The `DiffTaichi repo <https://github.com/yuanming-hu/difftaichi>`_ contains 10 differentiable physical simulators built with Taichi differentiable programming.

A few examples with neural network controllers optimized using differentiable simulators and brute-force gradient descent:
