How to contribute bug fixes and new features
--------------------------------------------------

If you are interested in resolving an issue marked with `"welcome contribution" <https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22welcome+contribution%22>`_.
Please first leave a note (e.g. *I know how to fix this and would like to help!*) on the issue, so that
people know some one is already working on it.

If no lead developer has commented and described a potential solution on the issue, please also briefly
describe your plan and wait for a lead developer to reply before you start.

Following this rule will prevent contributors from doing redundant work,
while keeping the solution simple and effective.
